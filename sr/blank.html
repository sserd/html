Make three different paper planes using old used paper. Throw them all with same force and record the distance and time of flight that plane took. Repeat the trial for three times for all the planes. In a Word Document submit the results of three trials with the image of paper planes. Comment on the effect of wing shape on the time and distance of flight.
